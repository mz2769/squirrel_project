# Squirrel Project
We built an application that can import the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census, and the viewers can add, update and view squirrel data.:squirrel:

Our application contains:
  1. A view that shows a [map](http://127.0.0.1:8000/map/) displaying the location of the squirrel sightings
  2. A view that [lists](http://127.0.0.1:8000/sightings/) squirrel sightings with links to edit each
  3. A view to update a particular sighting
  4. A view to create a new sighting
  5. A view with general [stats](http://127.0.0.1:8000/sightings/stats/) about the sightings
