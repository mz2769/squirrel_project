# Squirrel Project
We built an application that can import the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census, and the viewers can add, update and view squirrel data.:squirrel:

Our application contains:
  1. A view that shows a [map](https://even-gear-255421.appspot.com/map/) displaying the location of the squirrel sightings
  2. A view that [lists](https://even-gear-255421.appspot.com/sightings/) squirrel sightings with links to edit each
  3. A view to update a particular sighting
  4. A view to [create](https://even-gear-255421.appspot.com/add/) a new sighting
  5. A view with general [stats](https://even-gear-255421.appspot.com/stats/) about the sightings
